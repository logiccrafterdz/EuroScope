## 🤖 Smart Analysis Commands

### /comprehensive_analysis [query]
Full ReAct loop analysis with multi-step reasoning. Shows:
- Confidence score
- Reasoning process
- Tools used
- Final actionable recommendation

**Example:** `/comprehensive_analysis Should I trade EUR/USD now?`

### /quick_analysis
Faster analysis using simplified 2-step reasoning loop. Good for quick checks.

**Example:** `/quick_analysis`

### How It Works
The bot uses a **ReAct (Reason-Act-Observe)** framework:
1. **Reasons** about what information is needed
2. **Acts** by calling relevant tools (price, technicals, news, etc.)
3. **Observes** the results
4. **Repeats** until enough information is gathered
5. **Answers** with comprehensive, actionable analysis

## 🤖 Proactive Intelligence
EuroScope can autonomously monitor EUR/USD and send intelligent alerts without waiting for commands.

### How It Works
- Runs a ReAct loop every configured interval
- Decides if conditions warrant an alert
- Deduplicates alerts within a 60-minute window
- Prioritizes alerts as 🚨 urgent, ⚠️ medium, or ℹ️ low

### Example Alerts
- 🚨 URGENT: "Price sweeping liquidity below 1.0800 — reversal likely. Avoid shorts."
- ⚠️ MEDIUM: "Bullish breakout above 1.0850 with volume confirmation. Watch for pullback entry."
- ℹ️ LOW: "Market consolidating ahead of NY session. Wait for London close direction."

```

### How Skills Work
Each skill lives in its own folder under `skills/` with:
- `SKILL.md` — Description and capabilities
- `skill.py` — Implementation extending `BaseSkill`
- `__init__.py` — Exports

The `SkillsRegistry` auto-discovers skills at startup. The `Orchestrator` routes requests and assembles multi-skill analysis pipelines.

## Testing
**558+ tests** covering all modules:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
python -m pytest tests/
```

### Behavioral Validation
Run comprehensive behavioral tests against historical market scenarios:
```bash
python -m euroscope.testing.report_generator --output behavioral_report.md
```
This validates the bot's logic against:
1.  **Sideways Market Trap** (Avoiding false signals in chop)
2.  **Lagarde Shock** (Emergency response to news events)
3.  **Liquidity Sweep** (Detecting stop hunts)
4.  **Session Transition** (Handling market open volatility)
5.  **Macro Override** (Fundamental data impact)

## Vector Memory Maintenance
EuroScope cleans up old vector memory documents to keep semantic search fast.

Retention window:
```env
EUROSCOPE_VECTOR_MEMORY_TTL_DAYS=60
```

Manual cleanup:
```python
from euroscope.brain.vector_memory import VectorMemory
memory = VectorMemory()
await memory.cleanup_old_documents(ttl_days=30)
```
